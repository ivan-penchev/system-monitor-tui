System Monitor is a Text User Interface (TUI) application written in Go using the `bubbletea` TUI framework.

This software is developed as a learning project to introduce the concept of TUIs with Go. It is not intended for production use.
The author has also written an article that follows and explains the code, which you can find [here](https://penchev.com/posts/create-tui-with-go/)

To run the project, use the Go CLI and type `go run .` in your terminal.
